##Overview

You're going to program a simple and common coding interview question which is designed to filter out anyone who can't program their way out of a wet paper bag: Fizz Buzz.

##The program

Write a program that prints the numbers from 1 to 100. But for multiples of three print <code>Fizz</code> instead of the number and for the multiples of five print <code>Buzz</code>. For numbers which are multiples of both three and five print <code>FizzBuzz</code>.

##Simple enough?

Name your file fizzbuzz.c, again, create it in your local repo.
When you're done, add, commit and push.

You should also check that you the git stuff correctly by looking to see if the file is online on github.
